# Nepali Sign Language Detection Using CNN

This repository contains a project for detecting Nepali Sign Language using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project aims to facilitate communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by translating Nepali sign language into text.

## Features

- **Sign Language Detection**: Recognizes various Nepali sign language gestures.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes CNN for accurate detection and classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krispyarena/nepali-sign-language-detection-using-CNN.git
    cd nepali-sign-language-detection-using-CNN
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
